ml-scripts
==========

A bunch of scripts I wrote to automate common tasks with my Conestoga Mixed Learning courses. Use at your own risk (some are a bit hacky).

ml_pack.py - Packages up course files for uploading to my website
ml_clean.py - Deletes all student data in preparetion for next semester
ml_scan.py - Produces a list of unmarked goodies
